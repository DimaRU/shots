### Open the Sketch file to view step-by-step instructions.

#### How it Works
Replace five screenshots (750 x 1334) with shots of your iPhone app.

Using [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com/), edit or add to five artboards featuring your screens. Choose from a silver, gold, black, or rose gold iPhone 7 to frame your shots.

With some help from the [Sketch Replace Images plugin](https://github.com/shakemno/sketch-replace-images), Sketch generates all the sizes required by the App Store for iPhone 4, SE, 6/7, and 6/7plus.

Enjoy! :facepunch:
